COVID19 has caused me to become obsessed with the Scrabble Go app even though I am clearly not winning games. But it keeps me connected to my family across the United States. I love to see my Brother or sisters name come up that they just played their turn. It lets me know across the many miles that we are present together in the words on the board. 

In the past few years I have come to this place of connectedness. I know I am not the first to have arrived here. I hear others talk about it in things I read, or movies I watch. But I tell you sometimes I think I am the last to see it. My spiritual director calls it the narrow gate, I like to call it living in the present moment. It seemed I had lived here for a time when I was younger but as the stresses of life and the pain of loss pressed in it seems I had a whole other life. This was the middle part I guess. It lasted a good twenty plus years before I was able to emerge transformed. Please understand that I don’t think I have “arrived”, in fact many times I feel I am late to the game. Even in these most difficult times of shelter in place I see the silver lining (most days). I think this is what they call hope, not just the sentiment of the word but more than that. It’s in me and it can’t be separated from me. I mean it’s weird because for so long I faked hope or I strove for hope only to fail in achieving it.

I think the magic started when I connected my mind and body and spirit. This was not an easy task. In fact I am told not many want to take it on. It’s an inside job. There is only one person that can do it. It’s the person themselves. Finger pointing ends here and all your left with is your reflection in the mirror. It’s not fun, but it is so worth it! I didn’t have a lot of money. I couldn’t afford a therapist, I mean who can? So I went where it was free.  I had a faith, it was deep down, I knew about it but I hadn't experienced it. I sought help at the only church I knew and the only church I felt at home in. It was the Catholic Church. And during those middle years I drank deeply from the well of knowledge that it held for over two thousand years and believe it or not I found freedom within its walls.

My morning time of prayer and meditation turned into more than the rote prayers I leaned on when I didn’t have any of my own words. One morning while I was spending time in silence I was led to an interview through a reflection I was doing between [Bono of U2 and Eugene H Peterson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-l40S5e90KY&t=655s), the author of The Message. I think what I want to say is best taken from this translation,

> “ …Trust me. There is plenty of room for you in my Father’s home. If it weren’t so would I have told you that I am on my way to get a room ready for you? And if I’m on my way to get your room ready, I ‘ll  come back and get you so you can live where I live. And you already know the road I am taking…..Jesus said, I am the Road, also the Truth, also the Life….if you knew me you would know my Father” John 14:2.

Through inner work we uncover our true self and we meet our maker. It seems then that all the doors of the rooms are open, I can go in and out exploring and finding a common connection with the people I meet who are in different places. My hope  with this blog is that I can provide a source for reflection. The result would be, an exchange of Good will, a sharing of beliefs.

 Be well and be kind.

Through the eyes of a child….When this whole COVID shelter in place thing started coming down there was a lot going on. I was in my childhood hometown. After four months of cleaning out the attic, numerous pickups by California Veterans of accumulated stuff, my parents were downsizing. They sold their house of 35 years and were moving to a condo. It was four days after the the governor of our state announced quarantine. It was intense! The movers showed up and two of them were coughing and visibly sick. But I knew if we didn’t do it now we might not get a chance. So I sent up a quick prayer and ushered my parents into a room while I delegated the movers.

One of my favorite things to do when I would go to my parents for a visit is wake up early to have my alone time, but first I would walk to the donut shop a few blocks away. When I was a teenager I worked at that donut shop. I can still hear Borderline by Madonna playing on the radio as I mopped the floors at the end of my shift. 

so before the movers arrived I took that walk and it was like a ghost town. Where you would normally see cars lined up in traffic there were none. But what I saw was a mom and her daughter, 3 plus years old, walking towards me as they too were headed to the donut shop. The little girl was dressed in a princess dress and she was skipping and singing while she held on tight to her mothers hand. 

I walked in the door of the shop  and they followed behind me. The eyes of that little girl got so big and round as she saw the glass case with all the fresh pastry's. You would have thought there were diamonds in there. She started pointing at all the ones with sprinkles and bright colors. We chatted a bit about which were her favorites. She picked out the sprinkles and I picked out the glazed old fashioned-Actually two of those because they are my dads favorite too. 

As I walked back to the house not knowing what the day was going to bring I thought about that little girl. I thought about the contrast of what the children were feeling in these times and what the parents and adult children caring for their parents were feeling. Honestly, I could have been a lot more afraid than I was. I mean if I really wanted to be careful I would have sent the movers away when they rang the doorbell. But I didn’t, I sent that small prayer up and All I could do now was trust.

Trust is a big word for an adult who wants to have control. For a child it comes easy, they don’t know any different. It’s just the way it is, they easily trust. I have been thankful for my faith that I grew up with. It brought me this far. I practiced it because it was ingrained in me. I followed all the rules, I did what I was told, and I trusted. I have to say there were some dark years in there. Times I thought I had been buried alive and all I could do was lay there waiting. Waiting for this Resurrection I have been professing all my life but didn’t really understand.

It’s funny, this year Easter was different. No churches were open. I didn’t have to wake everybody up and make sure we were dressed in our Sunday best. We didn’t have to get in the car and lock the house up like we usually do. I didn’t have to worry what time it was and have my temperature rise as my husband took his time which would ultimately result in us walking in to Mass late, again! None of those things that I thought were so important happened this year. I woke early as usual and did my own spiritual practice. But this year I did not force anything. When my husband woke he went out to spend time with the trees and my youngest daughter slept until noon. But it was okay, because this Easter I was alive and grateful and I understood more clearly that we are all different, that God speaks to us in different ways and that if I let go and just trust, God would take care of the rest. I suppose I became more like a child myself this Easter Sunday that was so different from what I have ever known. my vision seemed to have cleared...

“Truly I say to you, whoever does not receive the Kingdom of God like a child will not enter it at all” Mark 10:15
